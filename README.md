# **📌 Project Title: SPACE STATION ENVIRONMENT – Interactive Analytical Dashboard**

## **📘 Project Description**

The **Space Station Environment Dashboard** is an interactive data-visualization project built using **Power BI**.
It provides a complete analytical view of **global space missions, ISRO satellite operations, orbital parameters, launch vehicles, and lunar observations**.

The project is divided into **four major modules**:

1. **Global Space Overview**
2. **ISRO – Satellite & Launch Analytics (ISRO-1 & ISRO-2)**
3. **Moon Environment Analysis**
4. **Home Navigation Page**

This dashboard helps users **monitor trends, compare mission performance, analyze orbital characteristics, and visualize environmental parameters** through dynamic filters and charts.
